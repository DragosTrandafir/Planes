# Planes
Considering an airport, operations with several planes (identified by name/number, airline  company, number of seats, destination, list of passengers) are handled, each plane has certain  passengers (identified by first name, last name and passport number)

--Solving complex problems: search, sort and 
other algorithms--

Objectives 
Development of classes in Python
• Develop an application based on the layered architecture
• Implement exceptions, document and test the code
• Learn how to develop algorithms for search and sort


Requirements 
The application should be developed along 3 consecutive iterations as follows:
1st. Iteration
a. Implementation
i. Domain and repository classes with CRUD operations
ii. test
b. Use modular programming
c. Give at least 3 data examples in the application (to facilitate testing)
d. Each function should be documented and tested (at least 3 
assertions/function)
2nd. Iteration
a. Implementation
i. sort the content of the repository
ii. filter the content of the repository
b. A single sort/search should be used for all requirements.
c. Give at least 3 data examples in the application (to facilitate testing)
d. Each function should be documented and tested (at least 3 
assertions/function)
3rd. Iteration
a. Implementation: group generation
b. A single backtracking algorithm should be used
c. Give at least 3 data examples in the application (to facilitate testing) 
d. Each function should be documented and tested (at least 3
assertions/function)

The solution ensures:
• Providing at least 10 data examples in the application
• Documentation and testing of each function
• Validation of data – when the user introduces invalid commands or data, a 
warning should be generated


All the additional documentation is provided inside the python modules.
THE MAIN MODULE should be run in order to start the application.
